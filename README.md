## Overview
This is an ELT pipeline project that uses Snowflake as a data warehouse and leverages data from the TPCH benchmark. The primary objective is to showcase the ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) operations using dbt for staging and modelling, whilst creating fact tables and macros to get meaningful insight on the TPCH dataset.
